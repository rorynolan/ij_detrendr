# Detrendr

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rorynolan/nandb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rorynolan/ij_detrendr)

Detrendr is an [ImageJ](https://imagej.net) plugin for detrending images with the _Robin Hood_ algorithm. This will mainly be of interest to those doing fluorescence fluctuation and correlation spectroscopy (FCS and FFS).

To learn how to install and use the plugin, visit the tutorial at https://rorynolan.github.io/ij_detrendr.

To learn about _Robin Hood_ detrending, read my thesis at https://rorynolan.github.io/phdthesis. Work on a publication about Robin Hood detrending is underway. 

Happy detrending!
