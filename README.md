# Detrendr

[![Travis-CI Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/rorynolan/nandb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rorynolan/nandb)

Detrendr is an [ImageJ](https://imagej.net) plugin for detrending images
with the *Robin Hood* algorithm. This will mainly be of interest to
those doing fluorescence fluctuation and correlation spectroscopy (FCS
and FFS).

The project is currently in its infancy. To read more, check out the
javadoc at <https://rorynolan.github.io/ij_detrendr/javadoc/>.

Work is underway on a [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) to explain the
plugin better, so if you can wait for that, do.

## Installation

The project is in beta so feel free to try out the plugin. The jar for
it can be found at <http://sites.imagej.net/Nool/plugins/>. To find out
how to install a plugin like this, see
