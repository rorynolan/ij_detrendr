["index.html", "Detrendr ImageJ Plugin Tutorial Introduction", " Detrendr ImageJ Plugin Tutorial Rory Nolan 2018-11-02 Introduction This is a tutorial on the Detrendr plugin for ImageJ (Rueden et al. 2017). This plugin implements Robin Hood detrending. For now, the only place you can read about this is in my thesis (Nolan 2018), but work is underway on a paper about this. So for now, if you want to learn about the Robin Hood algorithm, go there. This tutorial is about teaching you how to use the ImageJ implementation of the algorithm, it’s not intended to teach you how the algorithm itself works. For those of you who aren’t in love with graphical interfaces, this algorithm is also available as the R package detrendr which is on CRAN and is described in detail at https://rorynolan.github.io/detrendr/. This book is divided into two chapters: one detailing how to install the plugin and the next showing how to use it. They can be accessed from the left pane of this website. References "],

["use.html", "Chapter 2 Use", " Chapter 2 Use The following video shows how to use the Detrendr plugin. In this video, the image series contains some background, so thresholding is required. If your image is all foreground, no thresholding is required, so select thresholding method “None”. To view the video in full screen, view it at https://youtu.be/jNU033D0s28.
